XJ music enables composers to realize new possibilities in dynamic music for video games.

XJ includes the [XJ music workstation](/how-it-works/#workstation), a DAW dedicated to preparing dynamic video game music and the [XJ music engine](/how-it-works/#engine) to integrate the product within your game audio system.

The XJ music workstation and XJ music playback engine are software that implements the patented XJ music system ("XJ") for generating musical audio compositions, protected by US Patent Grant 10,446,126. This music software is intended for creating musical compositions for playback on a wide variety of devices.

XJ is founded on the core principle that music is human, enabling composers to realize new possibilities in dynamic music for video games. We seek to innovate whatâ€™s possible. XJ is a new algorithmic medium. We are building a new school of cutting-edge musicians who will put this system to work.

We work tirelessly on the XJ music platform to cultivate a compelling world for composers in our new music engine. In the XJ music Podcast, the XJ team shares highlights from our journey.
