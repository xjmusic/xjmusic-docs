When first opening the XJ music workstation, the user will have the option of demoing four demo projects from our in-house artists: Bump, Slaps, Space, and The Hero’s Journey. These demos offer users a firsthand experience of the workstation’s capabilities as a platform and can inspire creativity in their own sessions.
