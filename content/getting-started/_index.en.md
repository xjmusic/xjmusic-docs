In the Content section of the workstation, you will see the [Content Browser](/getting-started/content-browser/) which lists
all the the [Libraries](/making-xj-music/libraries/) in the current project. Inside of each Library
is a list of [Programs](/making-xj-music/programs/) and [Instruments](/making-xj-music/instruments/).

Open a program to edit it in the [Program Editor](/getting-started/program-editor/)
or open an instrument to edit it in the [Instrument Editor](/getting-started/instrument-editor/)
