When you first open the XJ music workstation, you'll see this empty space, because no project is open.

## Project Menu

The [Project menu](/getting-started/project-menu/index.md) provides a comprehensive set of options for managing project files efficiently. Creating new Projects, opening previously created Projects, saving your work, changing directory settings, and quitting the workstation is done here.

## Fabrication Menu

The [Fabrication menu](/making-xj-music/fabrication/fabrication-settings) displays two commands for the fabrication of musical segments, Start (CTRL+Space) and Follow (CTRL+ALT+Space).


## View Menu

## Content Tab

In the Content section of the workstation, you will see the [Content Browser](/getting-started/content-browser/) which lists
all the the [Libraries](/making-xj-music/libraries/) in the current project. Inside of each Library
is a list of [Programs](/making-xj-music/programs/) and [Instruments](/making-xj-music/instruments/).

Open a program to edit it in the [Program Editor](/getting-started/program-editor/)
or open an instrument to edit it in the [Instrument Editor](/getting-started/instrument-editor/)
