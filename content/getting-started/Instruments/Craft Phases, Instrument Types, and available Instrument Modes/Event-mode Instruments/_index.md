A polyphonic instrument such as a Bass-type instrument will provide a single audio per note. In that case each row (audio) in the instrument will use the tones column to store the note. The event column is ignored.

A Drum-type instrument will provide a single audio per drum event. In that case each row (audio) in the instrument will use the event column to store the event. The note column is ignored.
