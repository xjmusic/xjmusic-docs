In XJ music, an **Instrument** is a collection of Audios. While all instruments are stored according to the Instrument Model, different Types and Modes of instruments have unique purposes and behaviors.

The instrument menu contains a list of all instruments. Each instrument contains a configuration, which may affect the music when that instrument is chosen.

Here you can see the attributes of each Instrument, as well as the memes assigned to it.
