When first opening the XJ music workstation, the user will have the option of demoing four demo projects from our in-house artists: Bump, Slaps, Space, and The Hero’s Journey. These demos offer users a firsthand experience of the workstation’s capabilities as a platform and can inspire creativity in their own sessions.

To open a demo project, access the Project dropdown menu in the top left-hand side of the workstation, and choose Demos. Here you will find a list of four projects created by our team that will help you get acquainted with what the workstation can do. Select one and click OK to begin loading the project’s data, this could take a few minutes as you will be downloading the included audio files.
