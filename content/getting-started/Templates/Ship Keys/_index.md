Chains are shipped with unique identifiers called keys. Fabrication of Segments

XJ is essentially a traditional sampler-sequencer,[1] extended with new generative features.

Artists create a Template (Libraries of Programs, Instruments, and their Recorded Audio).

XJ fabricates a continuous series of audio Segments.

For each Segment, XJ chooses and arranges instrument audio, then modulates sources and mixes output audio.
