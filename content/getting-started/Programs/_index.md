In XJ music, a **Program** is a collection of musical instructions. While all programs are stored according to the **Program Model**, different [**Types**](/getting-started/Programs/Types%20of%20Programs/) of programs have unique purposes and behaviors.

Each program contains a **configuration**, which may affect the music when that program is chosen.

The program menu contains a list of all programs.

Here you can see the attributes of each Program, as well as the memes assigned to it.
