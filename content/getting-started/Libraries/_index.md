Libraries are collections of content within the XJ workstation.

When you open a Project, youâ€™ll see a list of all its Libraries.

Click on the name of a Library to see the content within.

Libraries contain two types of content: [**Programs**](/getting-started/Programs/) and [**Instruments**](/getting-started/Instruments/_index.en.md).
