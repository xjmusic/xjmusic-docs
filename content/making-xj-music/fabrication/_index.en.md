XJ music fabrication is the command center of the XJ music workstation, offering precise control over playback of your compositions.


## Segment Model

During fabrication, XJ constructs a Chain made of a series of **Segments**. Each Segment is a self-contained unit of music that can be played back in real-time or recorded to a file. Segments can be combined to create more complex compositions.
