Libraries are collections of content within the XJ workstation.

When you open a Project, youâ€™ll see a list of all its Libraries.

![Libraries](libraries.png?width=600px)

Click on the name of a Library to see the content within.

Libraries contain two types of content: [**Programs**](/making-xj-music/programs/) and [**Instruments**](/making-xj-music/instruments/).

The buttons on each row can be used
to Edit, Duplicate, or Destroy that Library.
