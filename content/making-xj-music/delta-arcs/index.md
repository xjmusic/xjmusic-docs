In the XJ music system, the main program is divided into sequences. Each segment is a musical composition that is based on a sequence.

The **delta** value of any segment counts from 0 (at the beginning of the main program) incrementing each segment by
the total number of beats in that segment. The delta value is used to calculate the relative position of a segment in the main program.

The **delta arc** value of any segment is the intensity of the segment. The arc value is used to calculate the intensity of the segment in the main program.
