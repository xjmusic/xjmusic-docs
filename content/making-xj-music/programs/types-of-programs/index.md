| Macro Programs  | Like a playlist, this describes an order in which to play songs a.k.a. main programs.                                                       |
| Main Programs   | Like a song, this musical notation describes chord progressions, as well as voicings of those chords for various types of instruments.      |
| Beat Programs   | This describes a beat, as in the foundation of a groove. XJ chooses one beat for an entire song (Main Program). This musical notation is used directly for a Drum Instrument to play. |
| Detail Programs | This involves transcribing the rhythmic pattern for a specific instrument, allowing XJ to interpret and apply it to any song based on its chord voicings. |
