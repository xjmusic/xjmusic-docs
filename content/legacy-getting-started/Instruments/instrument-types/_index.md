## Drum

Drum instruments contain audios that XJ will pair with Beats during the beat-craft phase. This can be any one shot drum event, including kick drums, snare drums, hi-hats, toms, cymbals, and more.

## Bass

Bass instruments contain melodic bass audios and can be played in all three instrument modes- event, chord and loop. Bass instruments are introduced during the detail-craft phase.

## Pad

Pad instruments contain sustained melodic pad audios that are typically used as underlying texture. Pad instruments can be played in event, chord and loop modes, and are introduced during the detail-craft phase.

## Sticky

Sticky instruments contain one shot audios that "stick" closely to the beat, providing a supportive, repeating, syncopated single note phrase that is usually done by a guitar but could be approximated by any sound provided that the notes are relatively short in duration. Sticky instruments can be played in event, chord and loop modes, and are introduced during the detail-craft phase.

## Stripe

Stripe instruments contain melodic audios that punctuate transitions, highlight important beats, or enhance climactic moments in the music. Stripe instruments can be played in event, chord and loop modes, and are introduced during the detail-craft phase.

## Stab

Stab instruments contain short percussive or chordal audios that are often created using synthesizers, electric pianos, or brass instruments. Stab instruments can be played in event, chord and loop modes, and are introduced during the detail-craft phase.

## Hook

Hook instruments contain memorable musical phrases or riff audios played by instruments such as guitar, bass, or keyboards. These hooks can serve as the foundation of the song's melody or provide a catchy motif that recurs throughout the composition. Hook instruments can be played in event, chord and loop modes, and are introduced during the detail-craft phase.

## Percussion

Percussion instruments contain audios that consist of rhythmic patterns or sequences of percussion instruments that are often used to add groove, texture, and rhythmic complexity to a track. These instruments typically consist of various percussive elements such as drums, cymbals, shakers, tambourines, congas, bongos, and other percussion instruments. Percussion instruments can be played in event, chord and loop modes, and are introduced during the detail-craft phase.

## Transition

Transition instruments contain audios that are used to smoothly move between different sections or parts of a song, scene, or composition. These sounds help to create cohesion and flow within the production, guiding the listener from one part to another and maintaining interest and engagement throughout. Transition-instruments can only be played in event mode and are introduced in the transition-craft phase.

## Background

Background instruments contain audio textures that are at least 1 minute (longer than any section). They are used to create an atmospheric backdrop and establish a sense of place, mood, or environment without necessarily being the focal point of the sequence. When chosen, XJ uses a random piece from within the available audio to fill each section when the instrument is chosen and builds in and out of layers of background audio the same way it does perc loops. Backgorund instruments can only be played in loop mode and are introduced in the background-craft phase.
