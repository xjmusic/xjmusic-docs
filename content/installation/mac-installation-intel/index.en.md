* Download the XJ music workstation Mac OS (Intel) installer ZIP file to your chosen directory.

* Extract the contents of the ZIP file with your extraction tool of choice.

* Double-click the DMG file to mount the installer disk image as a volume.

* Open the XJ music workstation installer volume that appears on your desktop (unfortunately, it is not named "installer" nor does it have an installer icon appearance) 

* Inside the installer volume, drag the XJ music workstation application into your Applications folder. 

* After installation, the XJ music workstation will appear in the Applications folder as well as in the Spotlight Search results.

* The first time you try to start a new installation of the XJ music workstation, Mac OS will refuse to open the application because this app is not signed. Choose the "View in Finder" option.

* In Finder, inside the Applications folder, right-click (option-click) on the XJ music workstation application and choose Open- this will override security and run the application.

* Repeat the previous step. For some reason, Mac OS forces this.
