**Engineer**  
Person skilled in the principles and practice of music technology, including but not limited to audio engineering, and the operation of musical generation systems.

**Digital Audio Workstation (DAW)**  
Electronic device or software application used for recording, editing and producing audio files.

**Audio Signal (audio data, audio sample, signal, audio, or sample)**  
Information that represents audible sound, such as a digital recording of a musical performance, persisted in a file on a computer.

**Generation**  
A process by which data is created, including but not limited to recording the output of a microphone or performing complex mathematical operations.

**Modulation**  
A process by which data is modified in such a manner as to alter at least some property, including but not limited to the amplitude, frequency, phase, or intensity of an audible signal.

**Configuration (config)**  
The arrangement or set-up of the hardware and software that make up a computer system.

**Audio channel (audio track, track, or channel)**  
A single stream of audio data. Optionally, two or more channels may be played together in a synchronized group. For example, stereo output is comprised of a left channel and a right channel.

**Audio composition  (audio mixing or mixing)**  
The process of forming new audio by placing together and uniting at least two source audio samples or channels. In the process, each source audio sample may be modulated such as to best fit within the composition of the final audio output.

**Audio mixer (or mixer)**  
An apparatus used to perform audio mixing.

**Audio event**  
An event which occurs at a specific position in time within a piece of recorded audio.

**Metadata**  
Information describing musical properties, including but not limited to events, selections, notes, chords, or the arrangement of audio samples.

**Series**  
Two items succeeding in order.

**Next**  
Being nearest in time, or adjoining in a series. In an empty series, the next item would be the initial item added to the series.

**Terminus**  
Either the initial or final item in a series.

**Static**  
Having a permanently constant nature.

**Dynamic**  
Having a changing or evolving nature.

**Permutation**  
The arrangement of any determinate number of things, in all possible orders, one after the other.

**Note**  
A musical sound, a tone, an utterance, or a tune. It may refer either to a single sound or its representation in notation.

**Pitch**  
The frequency of vibrations, as in a musical note. The exact pitch of notes has varied over time, and now differs between continents and orchestras.

**Interval**  
The distance in pitch between two notes. The violin, for example, is tuned in intervals of a fifth (G to D, D to A and A to E), the double bass in fourths (E to A, A to D and D to G).

**Harmonic intervals**  
The distance between two notes which occur simultaneously, as when a violinist tunes the instrument, listening carefully to the sound of two adjacent strings played together.

**Melodic intervals**  
The distance between two notes played in series, one after the other.

**Chord**  
At least two notes played simultaneously at harmonic intervals.

**Scale**  
At least two notes played in series at melodic intervals.

**Musical event**  
An action having been, or intended to be performed by a musical instrument, beginning at a specific moment in time, continuing for some amount of time, having characteristics including but not limited to chord, pitch, or velocity.

**Harmonic event**  
A single occurrence of an action having been, or intended to be performed by a harmonic instrument.

**Melodic event**  
A single occurrence of an action having been, or intended to be performed by a melodic instrument.

**Harmonic progression**  
The placement of chords with relation to each other such as to be musically correct and emotionally evocative.

**Key (root key or key signature)**  
A musical composition indicating the scale to be used, and the key-note or home-note. Generally, a musical composition ends—evoking resolve—on the chord matching its key. The key of a musical composition determines a context within which its harmonic progression will be effective.

**Voice**  
A single identity within a musical composition, such as might be performed by a single musical instrument. A voice is either percussive, harmonic, or melodic.

**Voice event**  
A single occurrence of an action having been, or intended to be performed by a single voice of a musical composition. An event has musical characteristics, representing a particular note or chord.

**Song**  
A musical composition containing a beginning, a middle, and an end.

**Section**  
A distinct portion of a musical composition.

**Partial musical composition (part)**  
A subset of a complete musical composition, such as to be interchangeable with other subsets of other compositions.

**Composite music**  
A work of musical art created dynamically from distinct parts or elements, distinguished from traditional recorded music, which is mastered and finished statically as a deliverable record.

**Aleatoric music (music composed “aleatorically”)**    
Music in which some element of the composition is left to chance, and/or some primary element of a composed work's realization is left to the determination of its performer(s).

**Program (musical program or main program)**  
A partial musical composition comprising or consisting of a progression of chords and corresponding musical events output of said related thereto and/or represented by stored musical notations for the playback of instruments. A program is comprised of at least some section representing a progression of musical variation within the program.

**Composite musical program**  
An integral whole musical composition comprised of distinct partial musical programs.

**Macro Program**  
This is like a playlist. Musical notation describing the order in which to play Main Programs.

**Main Program**  
This is like a song. Musical notation describing chord progressions and voicings of those chords for various types of instruments.

This describes a beat. XJ chooses one beat for an entire song (Main Program). This musical notation is used directly for a Drum Instrument to play. The beat is also used to make choices about other arrangements.

**Detail Program**  
This is writing down the rhythm of a part for one instrument to play, in a way that may be interpreted by XJ in for any song according to its chord voicings. The most atomic and portable sort of partial musical composition, and is intended to be utilized wherever its musical characteristics are deemed fit.
